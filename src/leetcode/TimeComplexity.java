public class TimeComplexity {
    /*
    is measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows with size of the input.
    helps to understand how fast your alg
    only based on worst case scenario
     */

    /*
    1. Big O 1: O(1) -> constant time complexity.
    Ex: numbs[4],  map.get(key)

    2. O(logN) -> N is the size of your input,
    Ex: binary search

    3. O(N) -> linear time complexity.
    Ex: Finds the max el from array.(1 for loop)

    4. O(N-square)-> quadratic time complexity. Nested loop.

   5. O(2 the power of N)-> Exponential time complexity.
   Ex: recursive method fib(n):..... return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
